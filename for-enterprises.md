# Is i18n enough?

We believe not. The closer the release date of your product gets the more obvious it gets, that instrumenting your code for localization is not enough.

There are more points to address:

- How does the translation process look?
- How do the source files get to the translators and back?
- How you deploy new languages after release?
- How do you handle versioning?

Translation Management Systems are a great help. But still there is a gap between development and translation process. Files need to be exported / imported / merged and all while new keys get added to be translated. The chaos is inevitable.
