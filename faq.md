## Misc

**i18next is awesome. How can i support the project?**

*There are a lot of ways to support us. Make a PR for a feature requested. Improve the documentation. Help others to get started. Spread the word.*

*Further you could try [locize.com](http://locize.com) - our localization as a service offering. It's like donating to i18next but with additional benefits for you - like saving hours of time translating your project.*


## Loading issues

**I don't see my translations!!!**

*Try setting `debug: true` on init and check the console log. There rather sure is a warning for unable to resolve the loadPath or invalid json. Check if the translation files are accessible via browser.*

## Translation

**How do i know which plural suffix i have to use?**

*On the [plural page](/plurals.md) there is a tool to get them.*

## Process

**How do i keep overview over my translation progress?**

*Might be time to use a translation management tool.*
